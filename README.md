# api-middleware

I am currently creating along with node some proof of concepts in usage of tokens, use of post/get/delete in app.get, and refining responses for user input (error 418!) in my api fetch methods. This is not meant to be a serious project but a way to document what my server side code will look like for other current projects. Soon I will be adding a repo on using databases and getting back user input. Learning to sanitize and usage of tokens will be updated in this repos.

Mainly this will be reiterated in future Python language and also provide a text-to-speech synthesis for error message.
